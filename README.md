## üìå Problem Statement  
Credit card fraud is a major concern in the financial industry, with billions of dollars lost annually. The key challenge in fraud detection is to identify fraudulent transactions from highly imbalanced datasets where fraud represents a tiny fraction of all records.

The goal is to build an anomaly detection system using unsupervised learning techniques that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives, suitable for real-time deployment.

## üéØ Objectives  
- Analyze characteristics of fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions  
- Build models using:  
  - Isolation Forest  
  - One-Class SVM  
- Evaluate with precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC  
- Deploy a real-time detection interface using Streamlit

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges  
- Extreme class imbalance  
- Anonymized dataset features (less interpretability)  
- Need for real-time inference  
- Managing false positives vs. detection rate trade-off
